<h1>A Little About Me</h1>

<p>This is the story of my life.  Some may find it rather dull while others may find it interesting, or you may find yourself deleting the page.  Whatever the case may be, I <del>hope</del>, no <ins>pray</ins> that I will receive a good grade, perhaps maybe extra credit in my attempt at humor. </p>


<h2>1.	Background </h2>
<p>   I am one of six siblings, five girls, and one boy.  I am usually the quiet one in the family and apparently the <q>all-knowing wizard</q> as well. Although the baby girl, I find myself being the go-to person in the family, whether it is for homework, taxes, personal advice, or even things I have <b>no</b> idea about. When I have time to myself, I enjoy curling up on the couch with a large mug of coffee reading a book, or surfing the web.  Three of my major passions I acquired at a very early age.  One is the love of playing piano (even though I don’t know how to read notes); another is the space sciences, and reading. I enjoy the peace and beauty of morning sunrises and listening to the birds sing. </p>
